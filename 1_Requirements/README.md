# Requirements
## Introduction
Contact Management System is a simple console application without graphics. It is similar to the contact manager in cell phones. In this  project, you can add, view, edit, search and delete contacts. All added and edited records are saved in a file.
You can list contacts by name, phone no., address and email. File handling has been used to record all data. I have used data structure to store the user name, email and contact.
